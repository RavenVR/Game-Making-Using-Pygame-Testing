# PythonPygameMovementStuff-BETA
this is just a thing, its where you can move and draw and stuff
BEFORE OPENING INSTALL PYTHON AND PYGAME
install python from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
then open a command window and type: pip install pygame.
if it gives you a error saying "pip is not a recognised command" then:
  1. type in command prompt: curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py, to get pip.py file
  2. then type: python get-pip.py
  3. finally to check if installed type: pip help.
if pip still doesnt work, then look at https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-pip-windows.

Ill most likely be updating this every week, if you also want to edit the file download VSCode or use IDLE (VSC download:https://code.visualstudio.com/download. download for IDLE: unknown.) ONLY EDIT THE FILE IF YOU KNOW HOW TO CODE IN PYTHON.

(BTW kkey.py is used to see every key press for events.)
